# Assignment 2

*find 3 HPC data science articles of non-top five of the top500 supercomputers, discuss research workflow, hardware, and cite
submit repo, branch, and commit hash via digitalcampus*

### My goal in this assignment is to do light research on the most greenest supercomputers of the Top500 list.

### Setonix - Rank 15 on 11/2022
This is the 4th greenest supercomputer on the Green500, and Australia's most powerful public research supercomputer. Manufactured by HPE, it supersedes its predecessor Magnus, which provided over two billion core hours and supported over 800 research projects, "including discovering more efficient ways to harvest renewables, creating a new atlas of the universe, and discovering gold beneath Australiaâ€™s soil". Setonix is 30 times more powerful than its Magnus and Galaxy predecessors, and also 1/5th of the size of Magnus. Setonix has completed phase 1 of its setup and will move on to phase 2 once its predecessors are decomissioned and removed.

### Frontier TDS - Rank 32 on 11/2022
Also manufactured by HPE, it has 74 cabinets - 9,408 nodes, and each node has one CPU and four GPUs. Tt is 100% liquid cooled and the only noise made is from the storage system that are air-cooled. This saves room on cooling like rear doors to exchange air. Cooling is the main focus of this supercomputer, which had sensors to track temperatures down to the individual GPUs. This supercomputer which supersedes the Titan, which required earmuffs to be around it, and the Summit.

### HiPerGator AI - Rank 38 on 11/2022
University of Florida has the honor of being the first university in the world to receive Nvidia's Ampere A100 GPU technology, which consists of 140 nodes - 17,920 CPUs and 1,120 GPUs. It was installed to expose students and faculty researchers to AI education across all majors and education levels for free. University of Florida IT aims to be the leader in AI as they offer the AI Fundamentals and Applications certificate and hope to see a large part of its students receiving it.
