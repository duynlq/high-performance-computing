I made sure that I was in $WORK by "cd $WORK", cloned spack.git, cd spack, set source and setup-env.sh, spack install gcc (compiler), cd spack-env, touch spack.yaml, nano spack.yaml, spack env create myenv, spack env activate myenv.

I did have challenges setting up the actual spack.yaml file and determining its contents, but seeing the 03_spack.yaml file uploaded by you on github, I will use this file instead.

No suggestions.
